## Running from source
You need to use nodejs 16.x, using `yarn` is recommended.

If you're using git to get this repo you should use `git submodule update --init --recursive` as well. If you're just downloading the archive.zip, make sure you download and extract deemix-webui into the webui folder.

Install the dependencies using `yarn install` or just `yarn`.
Then you should be able to run the app with `yarn start`.

You can change the default port by setting the environment variable `PORT` to any other number before starting the app.

## Building the app
Make sure you've installed the dependencies for all packages (the root folder, `server` and `webui`).  
Then from the root folder run `yarn dist` to make a distributable package for your current OS or `yarn server-dist` 
to make an executable for only the server.
